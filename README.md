# Polygon

A [Mac Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) inspired window manager for Windows 10/11 powered by AutoHotkey.

![Release](https://github.com/thesobercoder/polygon/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> Polygon is still a work in progress and aims to have 100% feature compatibility with Rectangle.

## System Requirements

Polygon supports Windows 10/11.

## Installation

### Installer

You can grab the latest Polygon installer from the latest [release](https://github.com/thesobercoder/polygon/releases/latest). The installer will place a shortcut to your user startup folder to ensure that Polygon start at Windows logon.

### Manual

If you rather want to install Polygon manually, please follow the steps outlined below.

- Download the compiled executable zip file based on your OS architecture from the latest [release](https://github.com/thesobercoder/polygon/releases/latest).
- Extract the `polygon-x[64|86].zip` into a location of your choice.
- Right click the executable and unblock it if Windows complain about security.
- Open the user startup folder by running the `shell:startup` command in the run (<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>) window.
- Copy the `polygon-x[64|86].exe` and the `polygon.ini` that you downloaded from the previous step and copy them to the `shell:startup` directory.

If you followed everything correctly, Polygon should start at Windows logon.

## Usage

Here are the shortcuts available in Polygon.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the shortcuts Polygon uses conflicts with Window in-built shortcuts and has been mentioned below. If you want to avoid these conflicts, please use the `polygon.ini` file to configure a different shortcut of your choosing by referring to the AutoHotkey v2 [List of Keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/KeyList.htm) documentation.

## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request, please open a new issue.

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome to fix bugs or to add new features.

### Environment

- You need to have [AutoHotkey v2](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey) installed.
- I recommend using Visual Studio Code or other VS Code based editors like Cursor.
- You need to have the `AutoHotkey v2 Language Support` extension installed by searching with the `thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp` extension ID.
- If AutoHotkey is located in a different location other than `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\v2\AutoHotkey.exe`, then set the `AutoHotkey2.InterpreterPath` setting to point to the correct location.
- You need to have the `EditorConfig for VS Code` extension installed by searching with the `EditorConfig.EditorConfig` extension ID.
- You need to have the `Prettier - Code formatter` extension installed by searching with the `esbenp.prettier-vscode` extension ID.
- Add the following lines to your VS Code settings.json file to enable AutoHotkey v2 language support.
  ```json
  {
    "AutoHotkey2.InterpreterPath": "<path to AutoHotkey.exe>",
    "AutoHotkey2.Warn.LocalSameAsGlobal": true,
    "AutoHotkey2.Warn.CallWithoutParentheses": "On"
  }
  ```

### Structure

The repository is structured pretty flat to keep things simple and find all necessary files easily. Polygon is developed as a single AHK file named `polygon.ahk` for now. I may in the future refactor it into multiple files if the push comes to shove.
